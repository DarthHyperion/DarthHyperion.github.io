        <h3 style="color:white">Remote Outdoor Water Monitoring Platform (Dec 2022 - Jan 2023)</h3><p style="color:white">Created a remote water monitoring platform with sensing capability for water temperature, turbidity, depth and flow speed. Collected data was transmitted over radio to the logging module, which processed and timestamped the data before storage. The project was fully assembled and tested.</p>

        <h3 style="color:white">FPGA Implementation of RV32I (Jun 2022 - Jul 2022)</h3><p style="color:white">Implemented a custom Verilog implementation of the RV32I RISC-V ISA and implemented it on PYNQ-Z2 FPGA-SoC board. Vivado IDE was used for development.</p>

        <h3 style="color:white">FSM Controlled Pump to Fill Two Tanks (May 2021 - Jun 2021)</h3><p style="color:white">Developed an FSM to control an underground water pump to fill two water tanks. FSM was designed and optimized by hand, and was tested and implemented using Proteus software for simulation and discrete digital IC&rsquo;s for hardware implementation.</p>

        <h3 style="color:white">Encrypted Radio Communication across Arduinos (Nov 2020 - Feb 2021)</h3><p style="color:white">I used a modified Vigen&egrave;re cipher to demonstrate encrypted transmission between two Arduino MEGA 2560&rsquo;s, over both wired serial and radio communication. (Radio communication took place using NRF24L01 transceivers.) The message was first encrypted, and the key number was appended to it. After transmission, the recipient would first extract the key number and then decrypt the message using the corresponding key saved on device.</p>
